<!-- Problem Statement -->
<section class="content-section">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, creating immense personal, family, and economic burdens, with millions suffering long-term impairments and significant costs. 
      Beyond its human toll, stroke places a substantial strain on the healthcare industry, generating billions in direct and indirect expenditures across emergency care, specialized treatment, rehabilitation, 
      and long-term disease management. These demands strain critical resources, expose workforce and access challenges, and reveal gaps in care for diverse populations, underscoring the 
      need for integrated, data-driven approaches that improve early identification, care coordination, and outcomes. Addressing the growing stroke burden requires sustained investment in 
      infrastructure, clinical capacity, and prevention strategies to reduce disability, improve equity, and control rising healthcare costs. 
      
      <p><strong>The Objective:</strong>Build a predictive model that can identify high-risk stroke patients based on readily available clinical data.</p>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>Business Impact:</strong> Early identification of high-risk patients enables healthcare providers to implement preventive measures, 
      potentially saving lives and reducing healthcare costs associated with stroke treatment and rehabilitation.
    </div>

    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Class Imbalance:</strong> Only 4.9% of patients experienced strokes, requiring careful handling of imbalanced data </li>
      <li><strong>Missing Data:</strong> Real-world healthcare data contained missing values that needed strategic imputation </li>
      <li><strong>Feature Selection:</strong> Identifying which clinical markers are truly predictive versus correlated </li>
      <li><strong>Model Interpretability:</strong> Ensuring the model can be explained to healthcare professionals for clinical adoption </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<!-- Methodology -->
<section class="content-section" style="background: rgba(24, 40, 71, 0.3); border-top: 1px solid var(--line); border-bottom: 1px solid var(--line);">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>This project employed a rigorous and reproducible data science workflow grounded in statistical best practices. The model's design and evaluation 
      were guided by the clinical objective of prioritizing the identification of true stroke cases, accepting a higher false-positive rate to support early intervention and risk mitigation. </p>
    
    <ul class="methodology-list">
      <li>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-database"></i>
        <div>
          <strong>1. Data Acquisition & Exploration</strong>
          <p>The analysis was conducted on a dataset of 5,109 patient records, each described by 11 demographic and clinical features, including age, body mass index (BMI), 
            average glucose levels, and relevant medical history indicators. An initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase was performed to assess feature distributions, 
            identify outliers and class imbalance, evaluate relationships between predictors and stroke occurrence, and uncover potential data quality issues such as missing or anomalous values.
            This analysis informed preprocessing decisions such as feature transformation, handling of missing values, and variable selection prior to model training.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-balance-scale"></i>
        <div>
          <strong>2. Data Preprocessing & Train/Test Split</strong>
          <p>Data preprocessing included domain-informed handling of missing BMI values. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets using a 
            stratified 80/20 split to preserve the original class distribution and ensure unbiased model evaluation. During the split I preformed feature engineering, 
            categorical encoding (work type, residence, smoking status), class imbalance correction, and numerical scaling for model compatibility. 
            Splitting the data early in the process is imperative to prevent data leakage which can inflate the model's performance metrics and create a false sense of effectiveness.</p>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-wrench"></i>
        <div>
          <strong>3. Model Development (Feature Selection)</strong>
          <p>A logistic regression model was developed using statsmodels, incorporating balanced class weights to address the low prevalence of stroke cases in the dataset. 
            This stage focused on statistical inference, leveraging statsmodels’ detailed diagnostic outputs to evaluate coefficient significance through hypothesis testing. 
            The results were used to identify predictors that were both statistically meaningful and clinically relevant, informing feature selection for the final predictive model.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-microscope"></i>
        <div>
          <strong>4. Assumption Validation</strong>
          <p>To ensure the statistical validity and interpretability of the logistic regression model, key modeling assumptions were explicitly evaluated prior to final training. 
            The linearity assumption between continuous predictors and the log-odds of stroke was assessed to confirm that feature transformations appropriately captured non-linear effects. 
            In addition, multicollinearity among predictors was examined using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis to ensure stable coefficient estimates and reliable inference. 
            These checks helped prevent distorted effect sizes and improved confidence in the model’s conclusions.</p>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-chart-line"></i>
        <div>
          <strong>5. Logistic Model Training, Testing, & Evaluation</strong>
          <p>Using scikit-learn, the finalized feature set was used to train and test a logistic regression model. 
            Performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to capture both overall classification quality and class-specific behavior. 
            Confusion matrix analysis was used to explicitly evaluate false positive and false negative outcomes, supporting informed trade-off analysis in a clinical risk setting.</p>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-gears"></i>
        <div>
          <strong>6. Threshold Optimization</strong>
          <p>Rather than relying on the default probability threshold, the model’s decision boundary was systematically optimized to reflect clinical priorities. 
            Threshold tuning focused on maximizing sensitivity for stroke detection, recognizing that the cost of missing true stroke cases outweighs the impact of increased false positives. 
            This step translated probabilistic model outputs into actionable classification decisions, ensuring the model’s operational behavior aligned with real-world 
            healthcare screening and early intervention requirements.</p>

<!-- Key Findings -->
<section class="content-section">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Key Findings & Insights</h2>
    
    <h3>Top Predictive Features</h3>
    <p>The model identified several strong predictors of stroke risk:</p>
    <img src="assets/stroke-odds.png" alt="Feature Coefficients & Odds Ratios" style="width: 75%; max-width: 1000px; height: auto;">

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Age:</strong> Most significant predictor—each decade of life multiplies stroke odds by 5.86× (486% increase)</li>
      <li><strong>Hypertension:</strong> Patients with hypertension have 1.83 higher stroke odds (83% increase) compared to those without hypertension</li>
      <li><strong>Average Glucose Level:</strong> Higher glucose levels moderately increased stroke risk (OR = 1.25 per log-unit increase, 25% higher odds)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Model Performance Analysis</h3>
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p><strong>Strong Generalization</strong></p>
        <p>With minimal train-test performance gaps in this highly imbalanced healthcare dataset the model demonstrates strong classification performance. 
          Close alignment across all metrics, particularly ROC-AUC and recall—indicates the model has learned true, underlying relationships between risk factors 
          (e.g., age, hypertension, glucose levels) and stroke outcomes, rather than memorizing patterns.</p>
      <p><strong>Clinically Aligned Error Behavior</strong></p>
        <p>Error analysis reveals the model's misclassifications are dominated by false positives rather than false negatives, meaning the model rarely misses true stroke cases. 
          This behavior aligns with clinical priorities where sensitivity is critical and false alarms are preferable to missed diagnoses.</p>
      

      <p><strong>Precision vs. Recall Trade-off</strong></p>
        <p>The model achieved 73% overall accuracy with a deliberate bias toward sensitivity. 
          Breaking down the stroke prediction performance:</p>
      <ul style="margin: 8px 0 0;">
        <li><strong>Recall (80%):</strong> The model successfully identifies 4 out of 5 patients who will actually experience a stroke—critical for early intervention.</li>
        <li><strong>Precision (13%):</strong> When the model flags a patient as high-risk, it's correct 13% of the time, resulting in false alarms for preventive screening.</li>
        <li><strong>Clinical Context:</strong> In healthcare screening, this trade-off prioritizes catching actual stroke cases over minimizing false positives. Missing a real stroke (false negative) has far more serious consequences than flagging a low-risk patient for additional screening (false positive).</li>
        <li><strong>No Stroke Class (99% precision, 72% recall):</strong> The model is highly reliable at identifying low-risk patients, correctly clearing 99% of patients it flags as low-risk.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Business Applications</h3>
    <ul>
      <p><li><strong>Screening Tool:</strong> Deploy as a first-pass screening system to identify patients who need comprehensive stroke risk assessment.</p>
      <p><li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Direct preventive care resources (lifestyle counseling, medication management) to flagged patients. Early intervention is a key to lower economic burdens.</p>
      <p><li><strong>Risk Stratification:</strong>Segment patient populations by risk level to prioritize follow-up care and monitoring frequency.</p>
      <p><li><strong>Early Intervention Pipeline:</strong>Integrate with clinical workflows to trigger automated alerts for high-risk patients, enabling proactive intervention.</p>
      <p><li><strong>Cost-Benefit Analysis:</strong>While false positives generate screening costs, catching actual strokes early prevents the far greater costs of emergency treatment and long-term disability care.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Next Steps for Improvement</h3>
    <p>Additional feature enhancement with additional clinical variables, tiered decision framework, model comparison to capture best fitting model, or external
      validation from different healthcare systems to assess real-world generalization.</p>
   
    <p><strong>Additional Clinical Variables</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Family history of stroke</li>
      <li>Detailed comorbidity data (atrial fibrillation, diabetes complications)</li>
      <li>Longitudinal measurements (blood pressure trends, glucose control)</li>
      <li>Atherosclerosis </li>
      <li>High blood cholesterol and triglycerides</li>
      <li>Medication history</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Tiered Decision Framework</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Low risk (< 0.3): Automatic clearance</li>
      <li>Medium risk (0.3-0.7): Flag for human review</li>
      <li>High risk (> 0.7): Immediate clinical attention</li>
    </ul>
